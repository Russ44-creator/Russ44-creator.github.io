I’m passionate about software engineering and have had the opportunity to work on some exciting projects. One of my recent internships was at SAP, where I developed automation suites using Pytest and Selenium to improve product reliability and implemented CI/CD pipelines for efficient software delivery. I also worked at GUYEE, where I collaborated on building a multi-field intelligent IoT platform for Volkswagen, enhancing factory management using technologies like Spring Boot and Vue.js. Currently, I’m involved in research projects at Brown University, including the development of PaSh, a tool for automating parallelization of POSIX shell scripts, and research on network protocols.I love tackling challenging problems and learning new technologies. Feel free to explore my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles to see more of my work.

CTFs involve participants solving challenges and puzzles in categories like cryptography, reverse engineering, web exploitation, and binary exploitation, in order to capture “flags” which are often in the form of codes or keys. Successfully capturing flags demonstrates a mastery of various cybersecurity concepts and techniques.\nWhile CTFs originate from the information security community, they provide valuable experience for any software developer looking to improve their security skills. Here are some reasons why CTFs and software security are worth understanding for any programmer:\nReal-world experience - CTF challenges are based on vulnerabilities and techniques used by hackers in the wild. Participating in CTFs gives you hands-on experience dealing with common software exploits like SQL injection, cross-site scripting, buffer overflows, etc. Identifying and patching these vulnerabilities will make you a better developer.Learn cybersecurity fundamentals - Core infosec concepts like encryption, hashes, encoding, cryptography, binaries, networking, and more are central to solving CTF challenges. Mastering these foundational building blocks is key for writing secure code.Gain offensive security insights - To find flaws and holes in CTF challenges, you need to think like an attacker and understand offensive security methodologies. This knowledge enables you to build robust systems capable of withstanding real hacking attempts.Practice makes perfect - The more CTFs you participate in, the better you get at things like quickly analyzing unknown code, identifying vulnerabilities, making connections, and finding creative solutions. These coding and problem-solving skills transfer directly to software development.Compete and benchmark skills - CTFs allow you to test your abilities against security experts around the world. Seeing how you rank compared to others can help motivate further learning and identify areas in need of improvement.While CTFs can involve some specialized security skills like expertise in certain tools or technical protocols, the core concepts align closely with secure coding best practices. Learning through CTF challenges helps instill the mindset and thought processes necessary for writing robust, hack-resistant software.\n","categories":["Insights"],"tags":["Insights"]},{"title":"Categories","url":"/2023/09/21/d0771a42bbc49a6941f59913fcda35e3/","content":"Research DiscoveryPersonal ProjectDaily Life\n"},{"title":"测试文章","url":"/2022/03/17/eb1908cb6cc7c14ffa02a18a052710e9/","content":"测试摘要！！\n\n\n标题一你好，世界！\n代码一echo &quot;hello world!!&quot;\n\n表格一\n\n\n标题1\n标题2\n标题3\n\n\n\n1\n1\n1\n\n\n2\n2\n2\n\n\n3\n3\n3\n\n\n流程图sequenceDiagram\n    小程序 ->> 小程序 : wx.login()获取code\n    小程序 ->> + 服务器 : wx.request()发送code\n    服务器 ->> + 微信服务器 : code+appid+secret\n    微信服务器 -->> - 服务器 : openid\n    服务器 ->> 服务器 : 根据openid确定用户并生成token\n    服务器 -->> - 小程序 : token\n\n\nflowchart LR\nA[Hard] -->|Text| B(Round)\nB --> C{Decision}\nC -->|One| D[Result 1]\nC -->|Two| E[Result 2]\n\n\n\n\nst=>start: Start:> http://www.google.com[blank]\ne=>end: End :>http://www.google.com\nop1=>operation: My Operation\nsub1=>subroutine: My Subroutine\ncond=>condition: Yes\nor No?:>http://www.google.com\nio=>inputoutput: catch something...\npara=>parallel: parallel tasks\n\nst->op1->cond\ncond(yes)->io->e\ncond(no)->para\npara(path1, bottom)->sub1(right)->op1\npara(path2, top)->op1{\"scale\":1,\"line-width\":2,\"line-length\":50,\"text-margin\":10,\"font-size\":12}  var code = document.getElementById(\"flowchart-0-code\").value;  var options = JSON.parse(decodeURIComponent(document.getElementById(\"flowchart-0-options\").value));  var diagram = flowchart.parse(code);  diagram.drawSVG(\"flowchart-0\", options);st=>start: Start|past:>http://www.google.com[blank]\ne=>end: End:>http://www.google.com\nop1=>operation: My Operation|past\nop2=>operation: Stuff|current\nsub1=>subroutine: My Subroutine|invalid\ncond=>condition: Yes\nor No?|approved:>http://www.google.com\nc2=>condition: Good idea|rejected\nio=>inputoutput: catch something...|request\n\nst->op1(right)->cond\ncond(yes, right)->c2\ncond(no)->sub1(left)->op1\nc2(yes)->io->e\nc2(no)->op2->e{\"scale\":1,\"line-width\":2,\"line-length\":50,\"text-margin\":10,\"font-size\":12}  var code = document.getElementById(\"flowchart-1-code\").value;  var options = JSON.parse(decodeURIComponent(document.getElementById(\"flowchart-1-options\").value));  var diagram = flowchart.parse(code);  diagram.drawSVG(\"flowchart-1\", options);","categories":["测试"],"tags":["测试"]}]
