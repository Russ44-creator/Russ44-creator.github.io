With Shiro, I could easily secure my Java applications and protect sensitive data.\nOne of the highlights of my journey was learning how to configure Shiro’s security features with ease. Its simple, yet highly customizable configuration made it a joy to work with. I integrated Shiro into my application and set up authentication realms and permission sets, allowing for fine-grained control over user access.\nHere’s a glimpse of what I learned in code:\n    // Shiro INI configurationsecurityManager = org.apache.shiro.web.mgt.DefaultWebSecurityManagersecurityManager.realms = $myRealmmyRealm = com.example.MyRealmmyRealm.credentialsMatcher = $passwordMatcheruser123 = password123, adminguest = guestPassword, guest// Securing a web route with Shiro/login = authc/admin/** = authc, roles[admin]\n\nWith Shiro’s straightforward syntax, I could secure web routes, ensuring only authenticated users could access sensitive areas. I also learned how to protect specific routes based on user roles, granting or denying access accordingly.\nShiro’s session management was another vital aspect I explored. It offered a seamless way to handle user sessions, and I could easily configure session timeout, cookie settings, and session persistence options. This made my application not only secure but also user-friendly.\nIn conclusion, my autumn journey with Shiro has been an incredible learning experience. I’ve gained a deeper understanding of application security and developed the skills to fortify my Java applications. Shiro’s flexibility and simplicity have made it a go-to choice for securing software, and I’m excited to continue honing my Shiro skills in the seasons to come. As the leaves change and autumn turns to winter, my commitment to safeguarding software remains as steadfast as ever.\n","categories":["Insights"],"tags":["Insights"]},{"title":"Elf Dynamic Linker","url":"/2023/09/23/3ecb9e75ca5ca9d3f65e40116c10e3e1/","content":"Elf Dynamic Linker\n","categories":["Personal Project"],"tags":["Personal Project"]},{"title":"About Me","url":"/2023/09/21/81d9f505441078e06980e0bd02616e94/","content":"Self-Introduction\nHi, I’m Lingfeng Deng, a Computer Science graduate student at Brown University.

This is where GraphQL steps in, offering a versatile and powerful solution for managing data queries and retrieval.\nData Retrieval:\nOne of GraphQL’s standout features is its ability to allow frontend applications to request precisely the data they need, eliminating the over-fetching or under-fetching of data. This fine-grained control enables React components and other frontend technologies to use GraphQL queries to fetch specific fields or objects, aligning data retrieval with the component’s exact requirements. This not only optimizes data transfer but also enhances application performance.\nComponent Data Loading:\nGraphQL makes it possible to fetch necessary data when a component loads or mounts. This means that before a component even starts rendering, it already possesses the essential data it needs, ensuring a seamless and efficient user experience. With GraphQL, you can preload data into your components, minimizing the need for subsequent data requests during runtime.\nSharing Data Among Multiple Components:\nIn complex applications, multiple components often require access to the same data. GraphQL simplifies this process by allowing these components to share the same data query. As a result, you reduce data redundancy, save on resources, and ensure data consistency across different parts of your application.\nLazy Loading:\nGraphQL supports on-demand data loading, which is a powerful feature when dealing with large datasets. With GraphQL, you can fetch data only when the user explicitly requests it. This approach is in stark contrast to traditional REST APIs, which often return fixed data sets. Lazy loading not only boosts application performance but also results in more efficient use of server resources.\nData Caching:\nMany GraphQL client libraries, such as Apollo Client, come equipped with data caching capabilities. This feature allows you to cache data locally, reducing the need for repeated server requests. By caching data on the client side, your application can continue to function offline or with intermittent connectivity, delivering a smoother user experience.\nDynamic Data:\nOne of GraphQL’s powerful capabilities is its ability to handle dynamic data. By passing variables to GraphQL queries, you can dynamically construct queries based on user input or application state. This flexibility makes it easier to build dynamic and interactive applications that respond in real-time to user actions.\nConclusion:\nGraphQL is a game-changer when it comes to data retrieval in web applications. Its ability to optimize data fetching, enable lazy loading, support data caching, and accommodate dynamic data requirements makes it a valuable tool for enhancing the performance and user experience of modern web applications. With GraphQL, you can take your data retrieval strategies to the next level, providing users with fast and efficient access to the information they need.\n","categories":["Insights"],"tags":["Insights"]},{"title":"Hello World","url":"/2023/09/21/b10a8db164e0754105b7a99be72e3fe5/","content":"Welcome to Hexo!
